# Snake++

A snake clone created in pygame for the Nokia 3310 game jam.

## Controls
Left arrow - Turn counter clockwise
Right arrow - Turn clockwise
Escape - Quit

## Screen size
The game jam has a restriction that games must be playable on an 84*48 resolution. This is pretty tiny though. To increase the resolution open 'scale.txt' in the 'assets' folder and enter a value between 1 and 10.
